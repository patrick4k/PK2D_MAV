# PK2D_MAV
One of my first major independent projects.

PK2D is a 2 dimentional game engine written in Java. I took my knowledge from my computer science two class and ran with it, thus some structure in the beginning of the project did not align with my knowledge at the end. I started this project without understanding event bases programming or even HashMaps (embarissing I know). Noneltheless I am proud of this project as it demonstraights that even with limited knowledge, programming is still full of endless oppurtunities.
